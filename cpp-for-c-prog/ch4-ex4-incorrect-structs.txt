Q. What is wrong?
A1. "a" is defined twice within the same file.
A2. There is a forward declaration of the sister struct within the brother
    struct. The definition of brother depends on sister, which has not yet been
    defined in the file.
    This would likely improve if brother and sister were defined in different
    files at the same level of hierarchy.
